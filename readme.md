# To Work On

 - Count iterations
 - Tests: add automated tests - lol
 - Add function to extract from model
  - dip finder uses this be we want that functionality other places
 - Add function to run the sat attaack
  - This function should probably take two filenames and return a key
    in hash form
 - Look into other benchmakrs to see what else you need to add
