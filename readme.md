# To Work On

 - Circuits with multitple outputs: this should handle that, but test it.
 - Add different gates
 - Add command line arguments
 - Tests: add automated tests
 - Wire buses: add a wire bus test case and split the wire buses into unique nodes
 - Oracle access: we have DIPs, now we need to consult the oracle and feed
   that back into the SAT formula
